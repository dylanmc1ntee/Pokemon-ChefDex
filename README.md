# Pokémon ChefDex

Pokémon ChefDex is a MERN stack web app for meal planning with a card-based interface. Ingredients are displayed as individual cards with macro data (calories, protein, carbs, fats), and meals are organized as binders that group these cards together. It's a playful way to build and track meals while keeping nutritional information front and center.

## Features

- Card-style display for each ingredient, showing key nutritional macros
- Binder-style meals that group ingredients into complete dishes
- Macro totals automatically calculated per meal
- Search and select ingredients easily while creating meals
- Designed with a nostalgic Pokémon card style

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- **Other Tools**: Framer Motion, Lucide Icons

## How It Works

1. **Create Ingredient Cards**  
   Add foods with their macro values. Each food becomes a reusable card.

2. **Build Meals (Binders)**  
   Combine ingredient cards into meals. Each binder calculates total macros.

3. **View and Edit**  
   Browse your binder collection, update ingredients, or adjust meals as needed.
